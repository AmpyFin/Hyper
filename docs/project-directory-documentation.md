## Overview

This documentation provides a comprehensive and detailed overview of the directory structure, design philosophy, and best practices for this project. The intent is to ensure that every contributor—whether new or experienced—can quickly understand the rationale behind the organization, the responsibilities of each directory, and the expectations for code quality and extensibility. This document is a living reference and should be updated as the project evolves.

## Directory Structure and Purpose

### `/adapters`

The `adapters` directory contains all modules responsible for transforming and normalizing data from external APIs into the internal format used by the system. This layer is critical for decoupling the core business logic from the specifics of third-party data providers, making the system resilient to changes in external APIs and simplifying the process of integrating new data sources.

**Typical Structure:**
```
adapters/
  current_price_adapters/
    binance_adapter.py
    coinbase_adapter.py
    ...
  historical_data_adapters/
    yahoo_finance_adapter.py
    quandl_adapter.py
    ...
  tickers_adapters/
    nasdaq_adapter.py
    crypto_adapter.py
    ...
  IAdapter.py  # (optional) shared interface definition
```

**Interface Example:**
```python
class IAdapter:
    def fetch_data(self, **kwargs):
        """Retrieve raw data from the external API."""
        raise NotImplementedError

    def format_data(self, raw_data):
        """Transform raw data into the internal standardized format."""
        raise NotImplementedError

    def handle_error(self, error):
        """Handle and log errors from the external API."""
        raise NotImplementedError
```

**Best Practices:**
- Keep adapters stateless and idempotent to facilitate testing and reuse.
- Document any API-specific quirks, rate limits, or authentication requirements in the adapter docstring.
- Write comprehensive unit tests for each adapter, including edge cases and error handling.
- Use environment variables or configuration files for API keys and secrets—never hardcode credentials.
- Ensure all adapters return data in the exact format expected by downstream modules.

**Design Rationale:**
Adapters allow the system to support multiple data providers simultaneously and make it easy to add or remove integrations. By enforcing a strict interface, the risk of integration bugs is minimized.

**Onboarding Tip:**
When adding a new data provider, copy an existing adapter as a template, implement the required methods, and add tests. Review the interface contract carefully to ensure compliance.

### `/clients`

The `clients` directory contains modules that orchestrate complex workflows, often involving multiple steps and interactions with external systems. Clients are responsible for managing the lifecycle of operations, handling retries, and providing a high-level API for the rest of the application.

**Typical Structure:**
```
clients/
  trading_client.py
  ranking_client.py
  testing_client.py
  training_client.py
  system_client.py
  IClient.py  # (optional) shared interface definition
```

**Interface Example:**
```python
class IClient:
    def run(self):
        """Start the client workflow."""
        raise NotImplementedError

    def stop(self):
        """Stop the client and clean up resources."""
        raise NotImplementedError

    def get_status(self):
        """Return the current status of the client."""
        raise NotImplementedError

    def handle_error(self, error):
        """Handle and log errors encountered during execution."""
        raise NotImplementedError
```

**Best Practices:**
- Design clients to be modular and composable; avoid monolithic workflows.
- Implement robust error handling, logging, and retry logic.
- Use dependency injection for external services to facilitate testing and extension.
- Document the workflow, expected inputs/outputs, and any side effects.
- Provide integration tests that simulate real-world scenarios.

**Design Rationale:**
Clients abstract away the complexity of interacting with external systems and allow the core logic to remain focused and testable. By using a shared interface, the system can swap out implementations (e.g., real vs. mock clients) with minimal code changes.

**Onboarding Tip:**
When creating a new client, start by defining the workflow in pseudocode, then implement the interface methods. Test with both real and mock dependencies.

### `/strategies`

The `strategies` directory is the home for all agent logic and simulation modules. Each strategy encapsulates a specific approach or algorithm for trading, investing, or decision-making. Strategies are designed to be modular, stateless, and easily swappable, enabling rapid experimentation and optimization.

**Typical Structure:**
```
strategies/
  momentum_strategy.py
  mean_reversion_strategy.py
  custom_agent.py
  IStrategy.py  # (optional) shared interface definition
```

**Interface Example:**
```python
class IStrategy:
    def initialize(self, config):
        """Set up the strategy with the given configuration."""
        raise NotImplementedError

    def generate_signals(self, market_data):
        """Produce trading signals based on input data."""
        raise NotImplementedError

    def evaluate_performance(self, trades, market_data):
        """Assess the strategy's performance over a period."""
        raise NotImplementedError

    def reset(self):
        """Reset the strategy's internal state (if any)."""
        raise NotImplementedError
```

**Best Practices:**
- Keep strategies stateless; use input parameters and return values rather than internal state.
- Clearly document the logic, assumptions, and intended use cases for each strategy.
- Provide unit tests and backtest results to validate performance.
- Use configuration files or parameters for tunable strategy settings.
- Avoid hardcoding asset symbols, timeframes, or thresholds.

**Design Rationale:**
A common interface for strategies allows the simulation engine to run, compare, and select strategies in a uniform way. This supports robust research and production deployment.

**Onboarding Tip:**
When developing a new strategy, start with a simple implementation and test it with historical data. Gradually add complexity and document your findings.

## Interface-Driven Development

A core principle of this project is interface-driven development. Every major directory enforces that all contained modules implement a specific interface relevant to their domain. This approach provides:

- **Consistency:** All modules expose a predictable API, making it easy for developers to understand and use new components.
- **Extensibility:** New adapters, clients, or strategies can be added without modifying existing code, as long as they adhere to the interface.
- **Testability:** Interfaces make it straightforward to mock or stub components for unit and integration testing.
- **Reliability:** Enforced contracts reduce the risk of runtime errors due to missing or misnamed methods.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Interfaces help maintain a clean architecture and prevent code bloat.

**How to Define and Enforce Interfaces:**
- Use abstract base classes (ABCs) or protocols (Python 3.8+) to define interfaces.
- Document required methods and properties in each interface file (e.g., `IAdapter.py`).
- Use static type checkers (e.g., mypy) and linters to ensure compliance.
- Review new modules for interface adherence during code review.
- Provide example implementations and tests for each interface.

**Example: Enforcing Interface Compliance**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class IAdapter(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def fetch_data(self, **kwargs):
        pass
```
