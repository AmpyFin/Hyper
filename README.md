# Hyper-Model

## Overview

The Hyper Model represents the cutting edge of growth-oriented trading intelligence, leveraging ensemble learning to capitalize on low volatility market conditions. This model identifies optimal entry and exit points during stable market phases, maximizing returns when market sentiment is positive.

## Key Features

- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines multiple technical indicator agents instead of relying on single strategies or trading guru suggestions
- **Performance-Based Ranking**: Ranks different technical indicator agents based on their recent portfolio performances. Better performing agents receive higher coefficients, giving them more influence in the final decision-making process
- **Growth-Oriented**: Specifically designed for bullish environments where opportunity identification and precise timing are paramount
- **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Tracks key growth metrics across multiple timeframes
- **Low Volatility Optimization**: Excels in stable market phases with positive sentiment

## System Architecture

The overall system architecture will be similar to the Prag model, with the key distinction that the Hyper Model is specifically trained during periods of market growth.

## Purpose

The goal of the Hyper Model is to move beyond traditional approaches:
- Instead of using one or two strategies
- Instead of following trading guru suggestions (which are often attempts to sell courses)
- Instead of relying on single technical indicators

The model leverages the collective intelligence of multiple technical indicator agents, continuously evaluating and ranking their performance to optimize trading decisions in growth-oriented market conditions. Higher-ranked agents with better performance receive higher coefficients, meaning they have more influence in the Hyper Model's final decision-making process.
